# Movix

Movix is an app I made for fun, trying to copy a UI I found from [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/5092314-Movie-website-single-page). Originally it was going to be a SPA but but it's not. Build with react, styled-components and react-router.

Main functionalities are: movie search and possibility to add movies to your favorite list.  
Utilises [The Movie Database](https://developers.themoviedb.org/) and FontAwesome icons.
